When creating a webpage for a pizza house, it's essential to include key information that not only attracts customers but also provides them with all the necessary details to make their dining experience enjoyable.
# ABOUT PAGE
![Home page1](About-page.png)
An "About" page on a pizza house website typically provides detailed information about the restaurant, its history, values, and unique features. This page helps build a connection with potential customers by sharing the story behind the business and what makes it special.
# SERVICES PAGE
![Home page1](services1.png)
Creating a "Services" page for a pizza house involves detailing the different services the restaurant offers to its customers. This page should clearly communicate the variety of services available, such as dine-in, delivery, catering, and any special offerings.
